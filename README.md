### TODOs

* Add more aesthetic elements;
* Add more features:
        - enemies?
        - hazards?
        - interactables (like doors, keys and treasures?)
        - etc...
* Add more things to test;

### Play the game

You can play the game moving around with 
WASD and jumping with Space.

You can import the required ml-agents folders with the link above.
ml-agents is required just for linking Unity to Python: I use my implementation for DRL algorithms.
